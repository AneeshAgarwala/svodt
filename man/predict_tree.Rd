\title{Predict with a Decision Tree}
\usage{
predict_tree(node, input, return_probs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{A decision tree object returned by \code{generate_tree}.}

\item{input}{A named list representing a single observation or a data frame of observations.}

\item{return_probs}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, returns class probabilities instead of predicted labels.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_probs = FALSE}, returns a character vector of predicted class labels.
If \code{return_probs = TRUE}, returns a numeric matrix or named vector of class probabilities.
}
\description{
Predicts class labels or class probabilities for new data using a decision tree
generated by \code{generate_tree}. Handles internal nodes, leaf nodes, and
both numeric and factor splits. Supports batch predictions for data frames.
}
\details{
- Supports numeric and factor features in internal nodes.
- For numeric features, splits are \code{<=} for left and \code{>} for right.
- For factor features, matches the split level for left; all other levels go right.
- Batch predictions for data frames are automatically handled row-wise.
- If a required feature is missing in the input, a warning is issued and \code{NA} is returned.
- Probabilities are returned as a named vector for a single observation or a matrix for multiple rows.

\examples{
data(wdbc)
features <- wdbc[, 2:31]
target <- wdbc$diagnosis
tree <- generate_tree(target, features, max_depth = 3)

# Predict single observation
predict_tree(tree, as.list(features[1, ]))

# Predict multiple observations
predict_tree(tree, features[1:5, ], return_probs = TRUE)
